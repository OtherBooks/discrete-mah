  <title>Project:  Edges with Equal Weights</title>
  <p>
    The weighted graphs presented in this chapter have all had the property that no two edges have the same weight.
    If, in the application of the greedy algorithms,
    there is more than one edge with minimal weight,
    we simply pick one of them at random.
    This means that we may get different outcomes depending on the choices we make.
    See how much variation there is in the outcomes when your class does the following problem.
  </p>

  <problem xml:id="prob_friends">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that you need to make a delivery to each of 11 friends and then return home.
        What's more,
        your car is in very bad shape and you don't want to drive it any further than absolutely necessary.
        Call your house A and the houses of your friends B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K and L. <xref ref="table">Table</xref>
        below indicates the distances between each pair of houses.
        You need to find a Hamilton circuit through the complete graph on 12 vertices, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K and L, which has as small a total distance as possible.
        According to what you learned in <xref ref="prob__bf_time">Problem</xref>,
        you are quite certain that you don't want to use the Brute Force Algorithm to find this circuit.
      </p>

    The example in <xref ref="prob_friends">Problem</xref>
    shows how the greedy algorithms are normally used.
    They are the best methods currently available to efficiently compute low weight Hamilton circuits when the Brute Force Algorithm is not feasible to use,
    as illustrated in <xref ref="prob__bf_time">Problem</xref>.
    However, there are instances where they can fail completely.
