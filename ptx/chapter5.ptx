  <title>Counting</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A more formal title for this chapter would be <em>combinatorics</em>.
      Many problems involving probability and statistics require knowing how many elements are in a particular set.
      Consider poker hands.
      What is the probability that a hand of five cards has two aces?
      To answer this,
      we would divide the number of five-card hands having two aces by the total number of five-card hands.
      We could list all possible five-card hands and then count the number of these hands that have two aces.
      Doing this would give us real insight into the problem,
      so listing is a very good way to solve counting problems.
      Many times after you start listing elements,
      you'll find ways to count the elements without listing all of them.
      If we could count the number of five-card hands having two aces without listing <em>all</em> of them,
      that would be more efficient.
      In this chapter,
      to solve a problem will mean to convince the class that you have counted all the items correctly.
      Perhaps you'll list all the items,
      or perhaps you'll list a smaller example to demonstrate the counting technique you used.

          <em>Multiplication Principle.</em>

          <em>Generalized Multiplication Principle.</em>
          Suppose that <m>n</m> is a positive integer and each of <m>A_1, A_2, \dots ,A_n</m> is a finite set.

          Suppose a mathematician has four different pairs of pants,
          three different shirts, and five different hats.
          How many outfits can s/he make assuming an outfit consists of exactly one pair of pants,
          exactly one shirt and exactly one hat?
          EXTRA<fn>I use this example to illustrate both Multiplication Principles,
          but perhaps more importantly, I use it to emphasize the very important aspect of
          <em>stating our assumptions</em>.
          For example, while this is a perfectly good textbook problem,
          the real world is never so simple.
          I joke that,
          as a mathematician, I have no worries about how what I wear actually looks to the rest of the world,
          but that this is definitely an assumption I am making.
          Others would place restrictions on which pairs of pants can be matched with which shirts.
          In each problem they present, I try to ask what implicit assumptions are being made and I have them write them down as we list them.
          Then I might discuss paying attention to which principle we are using.
          Since each of the four pairs of pants can be matched with any of the three shirts,
          you have <m>4 \cdot 3 = 12</m> ways to pick a pants/shirt combination.
          Once you pick one of the twelve combinations of pants and shirts,
          you can pick any of the hats,
          so you have <m>12 \cdot 5 = 60</m> choices.
          We used the Multiplication Principle twice to do this, but of course <m>4 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 60</m> so we could have used the Generalized Multiplication Principle.</fn></p>

          May we put multiple pictures on one card?

      In counting the number of ways we can select several objects from a particular finite set,
      two questions arise: Does order matter?
      Is repetition (replacement) allowed?
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a set.
          By an <term>unordered sample</term>
          of size <m>n</m> chosen from <m>A</m> we mean an <m>n</m>-element subset of<nbsp /><m>A</m>.
          By an <term>ordered sample</term>
          of size <m>n</m> chosen from <m>A</m> we mean an <m>n</m>-element sequence of <m>(</m>not necessarily distinct<m>)</m> elements of<nbsp /><m>A</m>.
          In this context,
          the set <m>A</m> is called the <term>population</term>
          from which the samples are drawn.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      For example, <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> and
      <m>\{2,3,1\}</m> are the same unordered sample of size 3 from the population of positive integers since order doesn't matter in the specification of a subset.
      In contrast,
      <m>(1,1,3)</m> and <m>(1,3,1)</m> are different ordered samples of size 3 from the same population.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using this language, we can restate <xref ref="p1">Problem</xref>
      as <q>How many unordered samples of size two can be chosen without replacement (or `<q>without repetition</q>) from the four-element <q>population</q>
      (Andrew, Bob, Carly, Diane)?</q>' In <xref ref="p2">Problem</xref>,
      we sought an ordered sample of size two without replacement (repetition) from the same population.
      Finally, in <xref ref="p3">Problem</xref>
      we desired an ordered sample of size two <q>with replacement</q> (or
      <q>with repetition</q>).
    </p>

          Suppose you are working on a ten-digit keypad to open a door.
          You know the combination is exactly three digits long.
          EXTRA<fn>When to present this example is always determined by the class.
          At some point they have discovered the three basic formulas that the first three parts of this problem illustrate.
          When I feel they have a grasp on these formulas, I think a summary lecture that discusses the concepts of <q>order matters,
          repetition is allowed,</q>  <q>order matters,
          repetition isn't allowed,</q> 
          <q>order doesn't matter,
          repetition isn't allowed,</q> and <q>order doesn't matter,
          repetition is allowed</q> is appropriate.
          The first three we have discovered and the last one, I leave hanging as a challenge.
          I've had students solve the last one in some quite clever ways and I've always taught them the formula once they did.</fn><ol>
