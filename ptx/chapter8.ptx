  <title>Traveling Salesman Problems</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Most phones and GPS units have the capability to allow you to input multiple locations and have the unit compute a path that visits all locations while minimizing your choice of time or distance.
      Does yours always find the best path?
      Ours don't.
      The unit most likely uses one of the algorithms in this chapter.
      The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) models a variety of different real world problems where we seek to minimize the time required to do something:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <title>work orders,</title>
          <p>
            where vertices represent repair jobs and weights represent times required to re-tool for the next job;
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>jobs on a machine,</title>
          <p>
            where vertices represent tasks and weights represent times to reconfigure the machine for the next task;
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>circuit boards,</title>
          <p>
            where vertices represent holes to be drilled in the board and weights represent times to rotate the board into the new position.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Returning to your employment status... Having determined that the shortest mail route required nine-hour days,
      you've decided to look for a job as a traveling salesman.
      A health food supplier is looking for someone to make deliveries to five stores in the region.
      <xref ref="HF">Figure</xref> shows the five stores and the distances between them in miles.
      You will be paid for each trip that visits all five stores.

      This looks good since you can travel at your own pace and won't have to worry about graph theory!
      Since you live near <m>A</m>, you decide on the loop,
      <me>
        A \to B \to C \to D \to E \to A

      which is

    <p>
      On second thought, you observe that you
      <em>could</em> travel the loop,
      <me>
        A \to B \to D \to E \to C \to A
      </me>
      which is only
      <me>

    <p>
      Your brain starts to hurt when you wonder,
      <q>What is the shortest route?</q>
      and <q>Just how many routes are there?</q>
      Back to graph theory and counting...

      Let's rephrase this problem in the language of graph theory.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>weighted graph</term>
          is a graph in which each edge has been assigned a positive number called its <term>weight</term>.

      <statement>
        <p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          A circuit which passes through every vertex exactly once is called a

          is a Hamilton circuit that has the smallest possible weight of all Hamilton circuits.

    <p>
      In graph theory terms, the <em>TSP</em>
      is the problem of finding a minimum weight Hamilton circuit.
      Notice that there is an edge between every pair of stores in <xref ref="HF">Figure</xref>.
      Such a graph is called <em>complete</em>.

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>complete graph</term>
          is a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.

    </definition>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many Hamilton circuits are there in a complete graph on three vertices?
          On four vertices?
          On twelve vertices?
          On <m>N</m> vertices?
          EXTRA<fn>We hope that a student discovers that given a complete graph and a vertex on that graph,
          there are <m>(N-1)!</m> Hamilton circuits that start and end at this vertex if we consider two circuits the same when they follow the same edges in the same direction. (In fact,
          there would be half this many if were also considered reversals to be the same.) When a student solves this problem, I typically demonstrate the following nice way to implement the brute force method by using a tree to see that we list every possible circuit.
          Consider the complete graph on six vertices, <m>A</m>,
          <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, <m>D</m>, <m>E</m> and <m>F</m>.
          Starting with <m>A</m>, there are 5 places we can go:

          The total number of inequivalent Hamilton circuits in this complete graph with six vertices is therefore <m>5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1 = 5! = 120</m>.</fn></p>

    <p>
      The TSP is more complex for non-complete graphs.
      As we have seen, a complete graph has many Hamilton circuits.
      In contrast, a non-complete graph may have no Hamilton circuit,
      and the problem of determining if a non-complete graph has a Hamilton circuit at all is a difficult one.
      Therefore we will consider complete graphs in this chapter except for the last problem of the chapter before the project section.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will study three different algorithms for solving the TSP, each of which is not completely satisfactory for a different reason.
      The first method we study is the one you applied above.

    </p>

    <p>
      This algorithm finds all optimal solutions,
      since we check every possible solution.
      However, the time required to execute the algorithm grows rapidly as we add new vertices.
      Suppose we have a weighted graph with 12 vertices.
      To decide if this graph has an Euler path,
      and then to use Fleury's Algorithm to find that Euler Path,
      might take 10 minutes.
      The time required to solve the TSP with the Brute Force Algorithm for a similar sized graph is somewhat longer.

          Suppose you want to use the Brute Force Algorithm to solve the TSP for a graph with 12 vertices,

          How long will it take you to check all of the different circuits?

    <p>
      This problem suggests that we consider other more practical algorithms.
      The next two algorithms are called
      <em>greedy algorithms</em>
      because at each step we do whatever is most advantageous to us at that moment,
      without planning ahead.

    <p>
      Now, repeat this process starting at another vertex.

          Circle the starting vertex of each one,

          Write under each one the weight of the path you get.

      We have seen the NNGA give us minimal weight Hamilton circuits while the time efficiency of the CLGA can come at the cost of a slightly less than minimal weight circuit.

      <statement>
        <p>
          In the previous two problems,
          the NNGA gives the minimal weight circuit found by the BFA and the CLGA gives the second to minimal weight circuit.
          Can you find an example in which the CLGA gives a minimal weight circuit but the NNGA does not?

      Since 1971, when it first gained public attention,
      considerable effort has gone into finding a good solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem,
      but no solution has been found that is quick, efficient,
      easy to apply
      (like Greedy algorithms)
      and guaranteed to work (like the Brute Force Algorithm).
      Considerable evidence suggests that no such solution exists at all.
