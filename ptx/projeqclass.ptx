      <p>
        Suppose <m>R</m> is an equivalence relation on the set <m>A</m>.
        Prove that the set of all equivalence classes defined by <m>R</m> form a partition of <m>A</m>.

        We might think of two compound sentences in propositional logic to be <q>equivalent</q>
        if they have the same truth tables.
        For example, the truth table below shows that every implication
        <m>p\rightarrow q</m> is equivalent to its contrapositive <m>\lnot q \rightarrow \lnot p</m>.
