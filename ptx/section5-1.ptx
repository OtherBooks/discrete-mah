  <p>
    Consider the simplest game of poker where we start with a fifty-two card deck and draw hands of five cards.
    The goal is to have the <q>best</q> hand.
    For example, three sevens beats two kings.
    Similarly three fours and two jacks (a full house) beats three aces (three of a kind).
    The order, from weakest hand to strongest hand,
    goes like this: High Card <m>\lt</m> One Pair <m>\lt</m> Two Pair <m>\lt</m> Three of a Kind <m>\lt</m> Straight <m>\lt</m> Flush <m>\lt</m> Full House <m>\lt</m> Four of a Kind <m>\lt</m> Straight Flush.
    We won't define and discuss all these possibilities.
    Rather, we will just pick two and ask the relevant question related to probability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why should three of a kind beat two pair?
    Well it must be that you are more likely to find in a five card hand a pair of threes and a pair of kings than three queens.
    The next two problems will demonstrate this,
    first by counting and then by probability.

              How many five card hands are there?

              How many five card hands have two pair in them?
