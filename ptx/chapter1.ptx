  <title>To the Instructor</title>
  <p>
    The first nine chapters of these notes constitute a three hour,
    entry-level course in discrete mathematics.
    The course targets a broad audience,
    including computer engineering majors,
    computer information science majors, computer science majors,
    mathematics majors and mathematics education majors seeking certification for grades four through twelve.
  </p>

  <p>
    The current version of the notes spring forth from an enjoyable and fruitful collaboration.
    From four different courses taught by David Clark and course material from Kathleen Shannon by way of Lee May, I extracted and rewrote material,
    leaving no line untouched.
    To mold these materials to my needs, I replaced introductory material with leading problems while adding definitions and problems to expedite student successes.
    From 2010 - 2015, I taught and refined these notes four times at Lamar University,
    a regional university of perhaps 11,000 undergraduates,
    while incorporating feedback from multiple faculty using the notes at other universities.
    In 2014, David took a renewed interest and helped proof and update all of the notes,
    catching errors and helping to further perfect and develop the mathematics into the polished result that you see here.
  </p>

  <p>
    Aside from the counting material contributed by May and Shannon in Chapter 3, the problems I added,
    and a few ideas borrowed from Charles A. Coppin and W. S. Mahavier,
    the material was extracted and modified from the following courses that Clark taught at SUNY New Paltz no less than 32 times between 1973 and 2010.

  <p>
    The present version of these notes includes a <q>Projects</q>
    section at the end of most chapters and a Chapter 10 at the end of the notes.
    This is all extra material that I do not normally cover in my Discrete Mathematics course.
    We have included it for the benefit of students who want to go beyond the standard course,
    or for instructors wanting to go more deeply into some of these topics and perhaps leave out others.
    In come cases the material in Chapters 1 and 2 will be sufficiently familiar to students that they could be skipped,
    leaving time for some of these additional topics.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my classes students work the problems and take a mid-term and a final,
    the average of which constitutes half of their grade.
    The remainder of their grade is determined by the problems they present and discuss in the classroom.
    This portion of the grade is subjective since one student may present fewer problems than another and receive a higher presentation grade.
    Perhaps this student regularly makes insightful comments during class that help clarify the mathematics for his or her peers.
    Or perhaps this student has chosen to present particularly difficult problems that illustrate the theory behind the more computational problems.
    At the end of the semester,
    having observed each student every class period, I know just how much of their heart and soul each student has put into the course,
    and how much each student has grown mathematically.
    It has been a joy to teach this class.
    In this class I seem always to have a high level of participation,
    discussion and mathematical growth across the broad spectrum of majors.
    The class is anything but homogenous.
    Not only are the majors quite distinct,
    but the students who take the course range from freshman to senior,
    some taking it early in their discipline and others having already been exposed to some of the material.
    As the instructor, I must take great care to assure that this unlevel playing field does not discourage any students who are seeing much of the material for the first time.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the first day of the course, I engage the class by learning names and asking students questions about majors and what mathematics they have studied.
    Without addressing the syllabus, how I will grade,
    or how the course will be conducted, I turn to the mathematics.
    I introduce a minimal set of definitions and axioms from set theory,
    along with Venn diagrams,
    giving the false illusion of an interactive lecture style.
    Then I put an elementary problem or two on the board and ask for Venn diagrams,
    which I encourage students to put on the board.
    Finally, I write this problem (Example 2 in the notes),
    <me>
      \A \cap (\B \cup \C) = (\A \cap \B) \cup (\A \cap \C)
    </me>
    on the board and ask them to draw the venn diagrams that would demonstrate either the equality or inequality of these two sets.
    Again, a student draws the diagram on the board and we discuss it as a class.
    Then I ask how we could prove this equality using the set equality axiom,
    that is, how do we show that
    <me>
      \A \cap (\B \cup \C) \subseteq (\A \cap \B) \cup (\A \cap \C)?
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    The moment a student feels s/he has made progress, I put the marker in their hand and have them show the class and start a discussion.
    And thus the first day sets a relaxed tone of investigating mathematics as a class along with student presentations.
    This would be an ideal first class.
    Sometimes, we don't make it to this example.
    Other times,
    a student merely acts as a secretary while the class as a whole tries to hammer out an argument.
    Wherever the class ends, I either pass out the first pages of notes or write a few problems on the board that the students are to try to work out during the next class period.
    They leave knowing to expect the exact same style of class the next day,
    students working at the board with the expectation that tomorrow we will have the solutions attempted and resolved before they come to class.
    I emphasize that it is fine to go to the board with an attempt that might or might not be a solution.
    Students always gain points by going to the board.
  </p>

  <p>
    In subsequent classes, I address grading and why I conduct class as I do when questions arise or during <q>dead time.</q>
    By the end of the second class day, I go over some rules for the presentations.
    They are not allowed any external sources for help <mdash /> only me and the notes.
    They are not allowed to present any problem they have seen elsewhere.
    They are not allowed to work in teams to solve problems.
    My goal is to see what they can do as individuals and what they can produce on their own.
    I encourage them to just solve <em>one</em>
    problem and I will be very pleased with them.
    And I encourage them to drop by the office when they need help or,
    if my office hours are not convenient, to email or Facebook me.
    I create Facebook groups for all my classes where students upload pictures and videos of class presentations and we sometimes discuss mathematics or teaching questions on these groups.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the exception of the very first day,
    the day of the midterm, and the day of the final, every day is identical.
    I come to class, determine which students have which problems,
    and give preference to students who have presented the least.
    It is not expected that each student resolves every problem,
    but rather that each student digs deeply into some problems and has something ready to show,
    even a failed attempt.
    Once I've matched the students and the problems,
    they write them on the board simultaneously while I circulate around the room answering questions about the work they have attempted.
    The students at the board then explain their work,
    and the class questions them over it.
    Students seem to have a natural grace at helping one another out the <q>right</q> amount.
    By this I mean that if a student is close to correct,
    then classmates will gently point out errors and allow time for repairs.
    If a student is way off base,
    the class will gently point out why what is stated is incorrect.
    When the work is correct,
    or sufficiently close to correct that there is general agreement,
    we accept the solution.
    When problems are incorrect,
    sometimes the student decides to work more and present it again at the next class.
    In this case they are expected to put it up before class starts since they know they are assigned that one.
    Occasionally, the solution is correct,
    but the class can't see why.
    This is common in Chapter 3, Counting.
    This is a difficult decision for me and my response depends on the confidence of the student at the board,
    the complexity of the problem and my perception of what choice will most benefit the student and the class.
    I may go to the board and clarify.
    Or, I may point out to the student that in industry,
    whether the solution is right or wrong isn't relevant if the boss doesn't understand it.
    And I joke that their bosses won't be as bright as they are and won't have thought as hard about the problem,
    so the burden is on them to make it sufficiently elementary with examples or good writing so that even the slowest boss can understand and know that the solution is right.
    And I'm very good at being very slow at catching on to a solution,
    right or wrong.
    Once problems have been presented, I will foreshadow upcoming definitions, axioms and concepts.
    These are not lectures,
    although I am at the front of the class, with marker in hand.
    Rather they are Socratic-style question-and-response sessions.
    <q>What is an inverse function....</q>
    <q>Ok, now I'm confused.... What is a <em>function</em>.</q>
    <q>Is there an inverse for every function?</q>
    <q>What about this one?</q>
    <q>I don't know what that means,
    can you describe the vertical line test in terms of sets of ordered pairs?</q>
    <q>The horizontal line test?</q>
    Thus classes end foreshadowing precisely the ideas that are likely to generate success on the next problems,
    but without working rote examples that illustrate
    <em>how</em> to work upcoming problems.
    If they understand the concepts,
    and the problems and writing are at the right level,
    they should be able to do the problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    In an attempt to give a flavor of how I use examples to illustrate concepts,
    there are a number of endnotes attached to examples and problems.
    Together I hope that these endnotes give you a taste of how I conduct my class.
    These very brief examples and explanations address the mini-lectures that I gave during the most recent iteration.
    These vary from semester to semester based on student questions,
    but are representative of what I emphasize via discussion and examples.
    Many of these examples never get discussed if students are making good progress,
    since student progress takes precedent over my daily plans.
    Still, if they are stuck,
    it's handy to have an example in front of me so that I don't make up an example off the top of my head,
    only to discover that it is already a problem in the notes!
  </p>

  <p>
    A few comments are in order to illustrate how I use these notes.
    Students work almost all the problems except the projects.
    Students are not required to prove the theorems,
    although I do throw in the problem on proving the binomial theorem and I prove a few theorems in class myself.
    I have not found it possible to make it through all the chapters in one semester.
    Therefore, I omit all projects.
    If one needs to make it to the last chapter,
    omit the chapter on Set Theory which takes up the first two weeks.
    There is one unusual aspect to how I teach the course because I do not proceed linearly through them,
    as I don't like segregating material by chapters.
    The best Moore Method courses I have ever taught
    (or taken)
    have simply been a list of problems.
    The advantages of desegregating material is that one can intertwine multiple topics.
    If two or more conceptual threads are intertwined,
    each student has at least twice the odds for success because there are multiple concepts being addressed on any given day.
    If one definition or concept is not understood,
    perhaps the other will be.
    In this course,
    as soon as one chapter starts to gel, I announce that they may read ahead and tackle problems in the next chapter.
    Sometimes we tackle two chapters simultaneously.
    For example,
    when we reached the induction chapter this past semester,
    we worked through both induction and equivalence relations simultaneously.
    Ultimately, I may intertwine these threads for my own use,
    but I find that picking up someone else's notes that are written this way makes it challenging to see just what is covered and makes it less attractive to potential users.
    Therefore, I have chosen to leave the chapters segregated for publication.
  </p>

  <p>
    In closing, I am deeply indebted to the Moore Method instructors under whom I studied.
    I am equally indebted to the authors who generously passed their notes to me for my use.
    I owe thanks to the many students who boldly plowed through earlier,
    less refined versions of the notes.
    And finally, I thank Auston Barnes,
    an undergraduate who worked through the last two chapters independently as an honors project in order to purge typos and improve several of the problems that gave him pause.
