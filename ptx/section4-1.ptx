    The word <em>identity</em>
    is used in a number of different contexts in mathematics.
    The function <m>f: \R \to \R</m> defined by
    <m>f(x) = x</m> is called the <em>identity</em>
    function because it identifies every number with itself.
    Similarly, <m>0</m> is called an
    <em>additive identity</em>
    because adding <m>0</m> to a number does not change the number,
    so <m>0+x</m> is identified with <m>x</m>.
    By the same reasoning, <m>1</m> is called the multiplicative identity.

    <statement>

        Let <m>\mathbf S</m> denote the set of all bijections from <m>\A</m> to itself.
        According to <xref ref="inj_fn">Problems</xref>
        and <xref ref="surj_fn"></xref>,
        <m>\circ</m> is a binary operation on <m>\mathbf S</m>, that is,
        <m>f\circ g \in \mathbf S</m> whenever <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are in <m>\mathbf S</m>.
        We define a special bijection <m>i:\A \to \A</m> called the
        <em>identity function</em> on <m>\A</m> as
        <me>
          i(x) = x \mbox{ for all }  x\in \A
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Show that <m>i</m> is an identity for <m>\mathbf S</m>, that is,

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f\circ i = f = i\circ f</m> and
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f\circ f^{-1} = i = f^{-1}\circ f</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        for all <m>f \in \mathbf S</m>.
        This shows that <m>i</m> serves as an identity for composition in the same way that 0, 1,
        <m>\emptyset</m> work as identities for <m>+</m>,
        <times /> and <m>\oplus</m>, respectively.

        <m>1 \to 2</m> and <m>2 \to 0</m>.
