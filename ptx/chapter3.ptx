  <title>Sets</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Every mathematics, science, and engineering course uses sets,
      the basic building blocks of mathematics, so we start here.
      It might seem that we should start with numbers.
      However, set theory is required to do a mathematically rigorous development of the numbers as well,
      so sets are the best starting point.
    </p>

    <p>
      We won't define the words <q>element,</q>
      <q>set</q> and <q>universe.</q> Rather,
      we will rely on our intuition.
      We will consider a <em>set</em>
      to be a collection of <em>elements</em>
      coming from some <em>universe</em> <m>\U</m> of elements.
      For example, if we are talking about numbers,
      our universe might be the set of all real numbers or might be the set of all integers.
      If we are talking about animals,
      our universe might be all animals in the San Diego Zoo or it might be all animals on this planet.

      <statement>
        <p>
          <term>Containment.</term> If <m>\A</m> is a set,
          then for each element <m>x</m> in <m>\U</m> either <m>x</m> is in <m>\A</m>
          (written <m>x\in \A</m>)
          or <m>x</m> is not in <m>\A</m> (written <m>x \not \in \A</m>).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </axiom>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\A</m> and <m>\B</m> are sets and every element of <m>\A</m> is also in <m>\B</m>,
          then we say that <m>\A</m> is a <term>subset</term>
          of <m>\B</m> and write <m>\A \subseteq \B</m> .

    <axiom xml:id="seteq">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <term>Set Equality.</term>
          If <m>\A</m> and <m>\B</m> are sets that have the same elements
          (that is, <m>\A \subseteq \B</m> and <m>\B \subseteq \A</m>),
          then we say that <m>\A</m> and <m>\B</m> are the same set and write <m>\A = \B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </axiom>

    <axiom>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <term>Set Specification.</term>
          If <m>\Q</m> is a property that each element in <m>\U</m> either has or does not have,
          then there is a set, denoted by
          <me>
            \{x \in \U \mid  x \mbox{ has property }   \Q \}
          </me>,
          whose elements are exactly those elements in <m>\U</m> having property<nbsp /><m>\Q</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </axiom>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The set <m>\R</m> is the set of all real numbers.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Are the sets <m>\dsp \A = \{ (x,y) \mid x\in \R \mbox{ and } x=\sqrt{y} \}</m> and <m>\dsp \B = \{ (x,y) \mid x\in \R \mbox{ and } x^2 = y \}</m> the same sets?
          What are some elements of <m>\A</m>?
          Of <m>\B</m>?
          EXTRA<fn>My primary goal on the first day,
          is to have some students write some simple solutions on the board.
          This seems a simple example, but my goals are many.
          I want to give concrete examples of two sets,
          to illustrate Set Specification Axiom,
          and to foreshadow the question of when two functions are equal.
          While I won't define function here, I will ask if these sets are the same.
          By getting them to list
          (at the board)
          elements of each set and perhaps even graph each collection of ordered pairs, I'll illustrate the notation we will use and we'll prove that one of these sets is a subset of the other,
          but not vice versa.
          Thus we will illustrate the notion of a proof and of a counter-example.
          With any luck at all,
          by the time we've discussed this example, I'll already have multiple students having gone to the board to answer the questions I ask.
          And I'll have politely asked them elementary questions that they can answer at the board.</fn></p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>empty set</term> is the set having no members,
          <me>
            \emptyset = \{x \in \U \mid  x   \ne x\}

      We can construct new sets from old using the Set Specification Axiom.

      The following illustrations are
      <em>Venn diagrams</em> for the sets just defined.

    <p>
      Different expressions might represent the same set as illustrated by the next example,
      which together with <xref ref="pp">Problem</xref> will show that
      <me>
        \A \cap (\B \cup \C) = (\A \cap \B) \cup (\A \cap \C)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="e1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For every choice of sets <m>\A, \B</m> and <m>\C</m>,
          <m>\dsp \A \cap (\B \cup \C) \subseteq (\A \cap \B) \cup (\A \cap \C)</m>.
          EXTRA<fn>After I illustrate the initial words (set, axiom,
          universe, venn diagrams, etc.) with the
          most basic of examples, I put this problem on the board and ask them to draw Venn diagrams that demonstrate this.
          Then
          I ask how we could prove it using the set equality axiom,
          that is, how do we show that
          <me>
            \A \cap (\B \cup \C) \subseteq (\A \cap \B) \cup (\A \cap \C)?
          </me>
          The moment a student feels s/he has made progress,
          I put the marker in his or her hand and have them show the class to start a discussion.
          <image source="images/a3b3058ca00e86c7adc3297bda80ac06ad1dafc0.png"/>
          <me>
            \qquad \A \qquad\qquad\qquad \B \cup \C \qquad\qquad \A \cap (\B
            \cup \C)
          </me>
          <image source="images/5134882e952e23ce8aa0c2ee38416a7a821cb4ea.png"/>
          <me>
            \qquad \A \cap \B \qquad\qquad\qquad \A \cap \C \qquad   (\A \cap \B) \cup (\A \cap \C)
          </me>
          To prove this via the <em>Set Equality Axiom</em>,
          we must show that every element in the set on left side of the equal sign must be in the set on the right side of the equal sign and vice-versa.
          We make progress on the first part in class,
          hopefully completing it and leaving the second part for homework (Problem 1).
          If we don't complete the first part, it becomes Problem 0.


          <em>Proof.</em>

          Let <m>\A</m>,<m>\B</m>, and <m>\C</m> be sets.

          We wish to show that <m>\A \cap (\B \cup \C) \subseteq (\A \cap \B) \cup (\A \cap \C)</m>.

          Let <m>x \in \A \cap (\B \cup \C)</m>. 

          Then <m>x \in \A</m>, and <m>x \in \B \cup \C</m>.

          So <m>x \in \A</m>, and either <m>x \in \B</m> or <m>x \in \C</m>.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                {Case 1.} <m>x \in \B</m>.
                Then <m>x \in \A \cap \B</m> and therefore <m>x \in (\A \cap \B) \cup (\A\cap \C)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                {Case 2.} <m>x \in \C</m>.
                Then <m>x \in \A \cap \C</m> and therefore <m>x \in (\A \cap \B) \cup (\A \cap \C)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          In both cases we conclude that <m>x \in (\A \cap \B) \cup (\A  \cap \C)</m>.</fn></p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      For Problems <m>1 - 19</m> we will assume that <m>\A, \B</m>,
      and <m>\C</m> are sets of elements from some universe <m>\U</m>.

      You are already familiar with operations on numbers such as addition,
      subtraction, multiplication,
      and division (<m>+</m>, <m>-</m>, <m>*</m>, <m>\div</m>).
      We have introduced the operations on sets such as intersection, union,
      and difference (<m>\cap</m>,
      <m>\cup</m>, and <m>\sim</m>).
      Soon, we will introduce more set operations,
      including <times />, <m>\oplus</m> and <m>\circ</m>.
      All of these number and set operations are referred to as
      <em>binary operations</em>
      because each operation takes two inputs.

      For the next problem,
      it is helpful to make the observation about the empty set that <em>any</em>
      statement starting with <q>If <m>x \in \emptyset</m>,
      then <ellipsis /></q> is a true statement.
      For example, the statement <q>If <m>x \in \emptyset</m>,
      then <m>x</m> is a seven-headed dog.</q> is a true statement.
      Why?
      Because the only way that statement could be false would be to have some value of <m>x</m> such that
      <m>x \in \emptyset</m> but <m>x</m> was not a seven-headed dog.
      But there is no such <m>x</m> since there is nothing in the empty set.

          EXTRA<fn>I don't always consider this example.
          Sometimes, it is needed for clarification, but often it is not.
          If there is dead time and it might help, I start discussing what they already know <mdash /> that intersection distributes over union and addition distributes over multiplication to make connections to other things they know.
          Then we investigate the example in class using random sets.
          For example, we might consider the sets
          <me>
            \A = \{0,1,2,3\} \qquad \B = \{2,3,4,5,6\} \qquad \C =  \{2,3,6,7,8\}
          </me>.
          If we compute both sides of our expression, we have:
          <me>
            \A \oplus (\B \cup \C) = \{0,1,4,5,6,7,8\} = (\A \oplus \B) \cup
            (\A \oplus \C)
          </me>
          This does not mean that <m>\A \oplus (\B \cup \C) = (\A \oplus \B) \cup
          (\A \oplus \C)</m> for all sets.
          Trying
          <me>
            \A = \{1,2,3\} \qquad \B = \{1,4,5\} \qquad \C = \{3,5,6\}
          </me>
          we get
          <me>
            \A \oplus (\B \cup \C) = \{2,4,5,6\}
          </me>
          but
          <me>
            (\A \oplus \B) \cup (\A \oplus \C) = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}
          </me>.
          This is what we call a <em>counterexample</em>, as it shows us that the statement is not always true.</fn></p>

      It is likely that you <q>know</q>
      what an ordered pair is from previous courses,
      but unlikely that you have ever seen a precise definition.
      The next two problems make precise the notion of ordered pairs.
      EXTRA<fn>The next two problems may be omitted if the instructor wishes to save a bit of time.
      Students all have an intuition for ordered pairs from their experiences graphing points in previous courses.
      Still, it is unlikely that they have ever seen a precise definition.
      Furthermore,
      it has been my experience that students in upper-division courses often do not know the difference between an ordered n-tuple and a set of n elements.
      While it is not necessary
      (or possible)
      to define every notion, I find part of the beauty of mathematics to be the definitions.
      Thus, I like to at least point out to my students that even though they know the difference between <m>\{a,b\}</m> and <m>(a,b)</m>
      (which some of them don't, so I'm being positive and giving them the benefit of the doubt),
      the notation <m>(a,b)</m> can be defined precisely in a way so that the properties we want it to have are in fact the properties that it will have due to the definition.
      Sometimes challenging problems like these remain outstanding for a week and I'll ask about them.
      If no student takes the challenge, we just work with ordered pairs and don't bother to work <xref ref="OrdPair">Problem</xref>.</fn></p>

      <xref ref="fail">Problem</xref> hinted at the property that we want from our new definition for ordered pairs.

      The next problem allows you to show that our definition for ordered pairs,
